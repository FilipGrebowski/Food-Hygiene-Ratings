# Food-Hygiene-Ratings

A JQuery and AJAX based project to make a dynamic web page that communicates with two server-side scripts. These scripts fetch the local restaurants in Canterbury and their Hygiene ratings. The system allows the user to search through the companies, and view their details. 

There is a search box implemented that stores the recent searches in memory and displays any restaurants that match the current input.
